# Codes and Data for DGRP lifespan analyses

### Data

#### Individual level data

* life.all.csv: Individual level lifespan data for all individuals across environments, the columns (comma separated) are: line,sex,vial,lifespan,block,temperature,vial-ID
* life.lnS.all.csv: Individual (pseudo) level lifespan microenvironmental variability data across environments, the columns (comma separated) are: line,sex,vial(pseudo),lifespan ln(sigma),block,temperature,replicate(pseudo)-ID

#### Data used for GWAS

* *.pheno: the data used for GWAS (http://dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu): the file name contains sex.temperature.phenotype (mean or lns) with .pheno as the extension. When there are two temperatures separated by a period, the phenotype provided is the difference between the two environments used for mapping plasticity QTLs. Within each comma separated text file, the first column is line ID and the second column is phenotype.
